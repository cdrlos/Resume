\opening{Dear Hiring Team at BAE System's Intelligence \& Security Department,}
I'm applying for the position of Data Scientist Support Analyst (Jr) (\#
62185BR) position. I am transitioning from a career in academia to one in
industry and government and based on the job description I believe this position
is great place for me to make that transition.

\noindent I have excellent knowledge of numerical analysis, numerical PDEs, and
probability as well as adequate knowledge of machine learning, neural networks,
image processing, and more recent experience in data science/data wrangling
statistical modeling (courtesy of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications' Math-to-Industry Bootcamp). I believe my qualifications are sufficient for this
posting.

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
