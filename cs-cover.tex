\opening{Dear Business Analytics HR department,}

I am writing to apply for the Data Analyst position at IU Health North Hospital. I'm a recent graduate from Purdue University's graduate program in Mathematics looking for a position is data science and data analytics. I have superb mathematical abilities as well as ample experience programming---primarily in Matlab and C, although I would consider myself more proficient in Python.

As part of my various teaching assignments at Purdue, I have used Excel (more precisely its open source cousin LibreOffice's Calc) extensively for calculating grade averages and standard deviations as well as heuristically determining cut-off ranges for letter grades. I am proficient in LibreOffice's Calc and Google Sheets and I believe this knowledge can be easily transferred to MS Excel.

Since I have been recently heavily leaning towards data science I have good experience with wrangling data in SQL. I am familiar with making queries, filtering, arranging, injecting data, making subqueries, and the various types of joins. I also have experience modeling and predicting target features from coursework and a recent bootcamp. Specifically, I have used R to predict the success (rating) of a book based on features such as the number of pages, authorship, the date of publication, and number of reviews on GoodReads using ANOVA with my regression model.

I must admit to having little experience with business analytics; the closest I have gotten to the subject is in my studies of Itô calculus, where I presented a solution to the Black--Scholes equation as part of a course. However, I am confident in my ability to pick it up.

I have complete trust in my ability to meet your demands. I look forward to speaking with you to discuss my qualifications. Please do not hesitate to contact me.

\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
