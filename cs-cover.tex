% the following commands control the margins:
\topmargin=-1in    % Make letterhead start about 1 inch from top of page
\textheight=8.5in  % text height can be bigger for a longer letter
\oddsidemargin=0pt % leftmargin is 1 inch
\textwidth=6.5in   % textwidth of 6.5in leaves 1 inch for right margin

\setlength{\textheight}{9.5in} % increase text height to fit resume on 1 page
% \newsectionwidth{0pt}  % So the text is not indented under section headings

\opening{Dear HR Department at the Chase branch in McAllen Neuhaus,}

I am writing because you recently rejected me from a role as Associate Banker at your branch in McAllen at Neuhaus. Well I ought to let you know that this is a grave mistake on your part because I would have doubtless brought your company profit the likes of which you have never seen before. You undoubtedly have bumble-brains working for you and I am happy that I dodged this bullet. I wish you success in staying afloat amids the pandemic. You likely were already making ends meet in large part due to Fortuna's infinite mercy.

\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
