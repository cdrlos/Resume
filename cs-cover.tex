\opening{Dear HR Department at the Chase branch in McAllen Neuhaus,}

I am writing to apply for the role of Associate Banker. I am a recent graduate from Purdue University's Graduate Program in Mathematics, so I have an amazing mathematical background. In addition I am fluid with language and have strong oral communication skills which I developed both as a teaching assistant and as a speaker at several of the department's student-run seminars.

I am more than confident in my ability to succeed in this position. Should you have any questions regarding my background, please do not hesitate to contact me.


\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
