\textheight=8.5in  % text height can be bigger for a longer letter
\oddsidemargin=0pt % leftmargin is 1 inch

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager at XPO Logistics' McAllen branch,}

I writing to you because I am interested in the position of warehouse associate at your McAllen location. I have experience working freight and receiving both at the Home Depot and the H-E-B. As part of those jobs I often operated machinery to stock and place bulk product in its appropriate location making sure to mark the amount and exact location with my RF device if need. I am very communicative, highly attentive, I do not make mistakes and I make sure to let my supervisor know about any problems that may arise in the work place. I have the ability to adjust my routine to my schedule so I can work any shift of the day. I have exceedingly good math skills and computer skills. You do not want to miss out on this potential employee.

I hope to hear from you soon.

\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
