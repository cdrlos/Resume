% the following commands control the margins:
\topmargin=-1in    % Make letterhead start about 1 inch from top of page
\textheight=8.5in  % text height can be bigger for a longer letter
\oddsidemargin=0pt % leftmargin is 1 inch
\textwidth=6.5in   % textwidth of 6.5in leaves 1 inch for right margin

\setlength{\textheight}{9.5in} % increase text height to fit resume on 1 page
% \newsectionwidth{0pt}  % So the text is not indented under section headings

\opening{Dear HR Team at Deloitte,}
    % I would be lying to you if I told you that working for a nonprofit organization has been anything but an afterthought for me; a career I did not consider very seriously. But recent developments in how I see the world and how I see the exploitation user-generated data for the sake of profit (and often at the expense of real human beings) has forced me to seriously reconsider my career aspirations.
I am writing to you regarding the Consulting Solution Engineering Analyst position. I am a recent graduate from Purdue University's rigorous graduate program in mathematics and I am looking to put my abilities to good use. I have an excellent foundation in theoretical as well as computational mathematics---think such subjects as numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, and numerical PDEs, but also wavelet analysis, probability, and machine learning.

Besides my technical skills, which I list in my resume, the most important skill I bring to the table is my problem solving abilities which I honed during my graduate studies, my ability to persist on a problem through to its solution, my ability to look at a problem from a perspective that does not come easily to many an engineer, and my fluency in formal mathematics.

\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
