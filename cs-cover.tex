\opening{Dear HR Department at DHR Health,}
\noindent I am applying for the Institutional Research Analyst position at DHR Health.

I recently graduated and am looking to put my problem solving skills to good use
and your college seems like just the place to start my career. I have 6 years of
experience working as a teaching assistant. As part of this work I managed
students' grades and employed a variety of heuristic statistical methods on them
to determine midterm curves and cut-off ranges for final grades. Moreover, I
have an excellent background in mathematics, particularly in the field of
geometry and abstract algebra but also in applied topics such as numerical
analysis, PDEs, and numerical linear algebra. I also have adequate experience
with linear regression, analysis of variance, neural networks, machine learning,
and computer systems and have used these skills to analyze several datasets
using R and SQL. I am excited by the prospect of using my skills to make a
tangible impact in the world and in my locality.

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
