\opening{Dear Charlene,}
\noindent I am applying for the Data Analyst position at New Mexico State University.

I am an all-but-dissertation PhD student who is looking to transition into a career in data science. I have six years of experience in academia---primarily as a teaching assistant, but also as a lecturer---where part of my assignment required me to record and analyze various statistics related to student performance on homework, quizzes, and midterms. I have practical programming experience in Matlab and Python for numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, and numerical PDEs and finite element method projects, and deep neural network projects and assignments I have completed over the years. In addition to this, I have participated in a number of Machine Learning and Data Science learning events the last of which was the PI4 Computational Boot Camp hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I learned RMarkdown and used it to analyze a subset of the GoodReads rating database and additionally wrote a reimplemented the (naive) k-means algorithm for classifying Parkinson's with great success.

While I have next to no knowledge of agricultural sciences, I am confident in my ability to learn and adapt to requirements for this position.

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
\end{letter}
