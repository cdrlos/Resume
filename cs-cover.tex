\opening{Dear Hiring Team at Duolingo,}
\noindent I am applying for the Software Engineer Intern position at Duolingo.

Having grown up near the border between the United States and Mexico and
frequently commuting between the two countries to visit relatives, I had the
privilege of being exposed to two different languages and in my youth would
spend a great deal of time making note the similarities and differences between
the two; and later, after discovering the wonderful resource that is Wikipedia,
between Indo-European languages at large. This interest really took off in
university where I took an intensive course in Russian. The course emphasized
correct pronunciation to the point that they devoted office hours and entire
exam sections to it. And I loved it! The grammar, the history, the phonology,
the poetry, all of it. Especially the phonology. From the emphatic consonants of
Arabic to the prosody induced by the vowel harmony in Turkish, I love the
diversity of sounds in foreign languages; it is quite literally music to my
ears.

Language has always been at the root of what interests me. I find that even my
choice of major in university, Mathematics, was influenced by the language of
the mathematician; a precise, unambiguous, symbolic language capable of
expressing ideas which in natural language can quickly become tedious.

As for what I bring to the table, dear Duolingo staff, I am enthusiastic about
language learning, yes, but I also have excellent knowledge of numerical
analysis, numerical PDEs, and probability as well as adequate knowledge of
machine learning, neural networks, image processing, and more recent experience
in data science/data wrangling statistical modeling I believe my qualifications
are sufficient for interning at your company.

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
