\opening{Dear HR department at the City of Dallas,}

I am a recent graduate (all-but-dissertation PhD) from Purdue's graduate program in mathematics who is looking to transition from a career track in academia to one in industry and government. Although my main focus has been scholarly thus far, I have some practical programming experience with Matlab and Python where I used the former for numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, and numerical PDEs, and the latter for deep neural network projects. Additionally, I am proficient in R, particularly in R's tidyverse package which I used in the PI4 Computational Boot Camp hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with my team to do exploratory data analysis on a subset of the GoodReads ratings database. In addition, I have advanced knowledge of (Postgre)SQL and ame more than capable of selecting, filtering, and joining queries. It goes without saying, as a former graduate student, I have a lot of experience learning and I will continue improving my skills in the area. I am confident in my ability to meet your demands.

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
\end{letter}
