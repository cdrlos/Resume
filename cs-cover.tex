\opening{Dear HR at Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages,}

I am writing to you with high hopes that you will seriously take my application for Point of Sales Clerk under consideration.

I am a recent graduate form Purdue University's program in mathematics who has had to return home in light of the pandemic. I am looking for a job close that will help me stay close to my family and which has opportunities to move up. Coca-Cola fits the bill. What I offer you is a punctual, hard working, very intelligent man with experience in retail, customer relations, mathematics, and so tech savvy he would be better placed with your IT team. I am super organized, very well versed in the Microsoft Office suite (especially Excel), and very attentive. You will find me to be an exceptional employee.


I hope to hear from you soon.
\closing{Sincerely,\\[5pt]
Carlos Salinas}
