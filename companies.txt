Description

Passionate about technology? Energized by business transformation? Deloitte Consulting LLP is looking for candidates with outstanding leadership experience, strong academic performance, and excellent communication skills to join our Analyst program. Analysts collaborate with our clients’ business and IT organizations to deliver business-led, technology-enabled solutions that help enterprises adapt to their unique challenges and opportunities. Each incoming Analyst is provided with a range of project opportunities to develop their skills and interests while also building a strong foundation as future leader at Deloitte.

 

Work You’ll Do
As a Solutions Engineering Analyst, you will be an integral member of a client service team, collaborating with diverse and talented team members to help solve multidimensional business problems, improve performance, and generate value for our clients across a broad base of industries. You will support the implementation of technical solutions to our clients’ most complex problems, ranging from standing up cloud infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies, designing dashboards that help business users comprehend complex processes, or even developing a technology strategy to support executive-level business objectives. You can capitalize on our cross-industry presence to find your niche and build your individual brand within the organization. This person should have strong analytical and critical thinking skills with the ability to solve complex problems and communicate findings.

 

While a career in consulting is dynamic and evolving, we look for people who will perform in specific areas, grow those related skills, and deliver exceptional results to our clients. We recognize that you have unique skills, experiences, and interests, so we divide the broad scope of the Analyst role into skills-based profiles in order to best align each Analyst with a focus area. Setting our people up for success is our highest priority.

A Solutions Engineering Analyst supports design, implementation, and operation of ‘heart of the business’ systems in order to enhance clients’ technology capabilities and deliver on enterprise objectives. The Consultant continually develops new skills while assisting clients in building optimized solutions across the organization. We look for a problem solver who’s excited to work with disruptive technologies and has the right blend of practicality and ingenuity to make the most of those technologies. While not limited to these roles, this person may wish to grow to become a technical architect, integration expert, data architect or seasoned developer.

 

The Team
Our Deloitte Consulting team plays a major role in directly embedding technology insights into our clients’ organizational goals. At Deloitte, our consultants create sharply-focused solutions within an organization’s operating model, accounting for its people, intellectual capital, technology, and processes. Engagement teams at Deloitte drive value for our clients but also understand the importance of developing resources and contributing to the communities in which we work. We make it our business to take issue to impact, both within and beyond a client setting.

How You’ll Grow
Two of the most important tools in today’s business world are experience and resources. At Deloitte, you’ll find plenty of both. We believe in equipping our people with some of the best resources available and offering the experience, education, and opportunities you’ll need at various stages of your career to be technologically fluent. As a new Analyst, you will attend a series of onboarding programs to develop foundational knowledge, build essential core consulting skills, and cultivate an in-depth understanding of Deloitte Consulting’s methodologies.

Beyond the formal training, you will be part of the national analyst community, which fosters opportunities to add additional dimensions to your experiences through internal initiatives, programs, and events such as skills-based service trips, local office learning events, and internal innovation challenges.
